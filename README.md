# Pong-rust

Implementation of the game Pong using rust as programming language.

For this project I followed the "vulkan tutorial" up to the index buffers part using `unkownue/vulkan-tutorial-rust` repository as inspiration.

# Getting started

## Compile shaders

On the root of the project, run this command:

`scripts/compile-shaders.sh shaders/src shaders/spv`
